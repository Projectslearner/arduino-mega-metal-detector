# Metal Detector

#### Project Overview

The **Metal Detector** project utilizes an Arduino Mega along with a coil to detect the presence of metal. This simple yet effective setup demonstrates how basic electromagnetic principles can be used for metal detection applications.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Metal Detector Coil**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Metal Detector Coil to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin**: Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Mega.
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Metal Detector Coil to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for readings:
     - **Metal Detected!:** Indicates that the metal detector coil has detected metal (output is HIGH).
     - No output indicates no metal detected.

#### Applications

- **Security Screening:** Use in handheld or stationary metal detectors for security checks.
- **Treasure Hunting:** Build into a metal detector device for hobbyists and enthusiasts.
- **Industrial Applications:** Integrate into conveyor belts or machinery to detect metal contaminants.

#### Notes

- Ensure the metal detector coil is positioned correctly and calibrated for optimal sensitivity.
- Adjust the detection threshold or sensitivity based on the size and type of metals you want to detect.
- Experiment with different coil designs and configurations to optimize performance for specific applications.
